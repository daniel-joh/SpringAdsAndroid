# SpringAdsAndroid
SpringAds is a project that consists of 2 parts:
1. Spring Boot project that implements a REST Web service. Spring Data JPA is used for persistence. https://github.com/daniel-joh/SpringAds
2. Android app (this repository) that uses the SpringAds REST service. The app is a prototype of an app for ads, like Blocket.

## Installation
IP address of the SpringAds REST web service has to be set in HelperUtils.HOST.

## Notes
Spring for Android is used for REST calls to the web service.
Google Sign-in API is used for user authentication.
